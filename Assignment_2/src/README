Quinn Alfaro Runtime analysis Assignment 2:



    Building the Graph:

        O(m n^2) where m = number of movies and n = number of actors  in each film

        This runtime factors in the fact that the program must first iterate through each of the films
        and then perform a nxn iteration of each film as a double for loop where it adds each actor and
        each of their connections (costars)

    Searching the Graph:

        O(e^d) where e is the number of edges and d is the depth you must go in the graph

        A breadth first search is performed checking first all of an actors costars and then all of their costars
        costars. There is an exponential time growth the deeper you go with each actor having to then be searched
        with all of their costars. While the fastest possible runtime is constant time, a breadth first search seemed
        more practical than a depth first search as a depth first search could you to go down huge depth of the graph
        which ultimately could lead to no result.
